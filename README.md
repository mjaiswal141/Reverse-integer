# Reverse-integer
Reverse an integer entered by the user in C++ programming.
This problem is solved by using while loop.
This program takes an integer input from the user and stores it in variable n.
Then the while loop is iterated until n != 0 is false.
In each iteration, the remainder when the value of n is divided by 10 is calculated, reversedNumber is computed and the value of n is decreased 10 fold.
Finally, the reversedNumber (which contains the reversed number) is printed on the screen.
